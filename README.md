## Objective
To categorize countries based on socio-economic and health factors that determine their overall development. This will help HELP International strategically allocate funds to the nations most in need.

## About HELP International
HELP International is a global humanitarian NGO committed to fighting poverty and providing basic amenities to underprivileged communities. The organization also offers disaster relief and assistance to countries affected by natural calamities.

## Problem Statement
HELP International has successfully raised $10 million and aims to distribute these funds effectively. The CEO needs to decide which countries require urgent aid. As a Data Scientist, your task is to analyze socio-economic and health-related factors to classify countries based on their development levels. Based on this categorization, you will recommend the countries that should receive the highest priority for aid allocation.

## Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Gather socio-economic and health-related data for various countries.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, standardize features, and prepare the dataset.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze patterns and insights from the data.
4. **Clustering Techniques**: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to categorize countries.
5. **Evaluation & Insights**: Identify key country groups and recommend high-priority nations for aid.
6. **Visualization & Reporting**: Generate visual reports to support decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Clustering Algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Data Visualization Tools

## Results & Recommendations
- Countries have been categorized into different groups based on their socio-economic and health indicators.
- The CEO can use these insights to prioritize aid allocation effectively.
- The final report highlights the most underdeveloped countries in dire need of support.
